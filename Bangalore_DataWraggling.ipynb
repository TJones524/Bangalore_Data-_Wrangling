    "1.2  Data Wrangling\n",
    "1.2.1  Description of process\n",
    "The data set in Kaggle included a total of 6208 properties. Unfortunately many of them had missing data including a major one for my research. I had to reduce the data set to 1856 properties that included information for most of the 40 different variables. The variable had decriptions of ammenities and features for each property. for each property there was information on the price, the neighborhood that it was located in, the square footage, the region/state the property was located in, number of times times it was sold. In addition information regarding ammenities included in the building was also in the data set such as elevator, maintenance, cafeteria, garden, gymnasium, etc. Extraneous data regarding the appliances and furniture that the appartment or house offered were also included in some cases, and conclusions on if the apartment was furnished or not, was possible to be reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were a few variables such as Wifi and AC that were indicating that these were not available for any of the apartments in the data set and they were removed from the working data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "I cleaned up my data by getting rid of some factors that could skew analysis based on missing data. I then assessed how I could bundle some categories together to make larger, more useful ones. The four I came up with were furniture, fitness, appliances, and entertainment. Knowling that in the US an apartment or house comes with appliances, it was interesting to identify obsevations in my dataset where the number of appliances was zero. This was one of the reasons why I combined these together. Regarding the furniture, I wanted to create a variable that was focusing on furnished vs unfurnished apartments and their differences. Unfortunately the number of funished apartments in the dataset was limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to identify categories of apartments based on the luxury and I focused on some variables that could be categorized as luxury amenities. I split those into two categories fitness and entertainment. It was interesting to see that fitness was a major predictor on the price of the apartment.\n",
